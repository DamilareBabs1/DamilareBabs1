### 💡 About Me

I'm a backend developer who is passionate about writing code that solves real-world problems. I believe in the power of tech to transform communities, and I’m on a mission to use code as a tool to uplift Africa and beyond.

I'm currently learning backend development through the **ALX SE Program**, and I’m excited to expand into full stack development next. I completed the **Virtual Assistant track with ALX** prior to this, and now I'm focused on building powerful and purposeful software solutions.
